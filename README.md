# Insurance Claims Blockchain

The Insurance Claims Blockchain is a decentralized application (DApp) built on a blockchain network to manage insurance claims transactions securely and transparently. It provides a reliable and tamper-proof ledger to record insurance claims and facilitates efficient claim processing and settlement.

## Features

- Blockchain-based ledger for storing insurance claims transactions
- Secure transaction validation using digital signatures
- Mining mechanism to create new blocks and maintain the integrity of the blockchain
- Consensus algorithm for resolving conflicts among multiple nodes
- RESTful API for interacting with the blockchain network
- Node registration and synchronization for maintaining a distributed network

## Getting Started

These instructions will guide you on how to set up and run the Insurance Claims Blockchain on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Flask
- Crypto

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SamsonWanjiku/insurance-claims-blockchain.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd insurance-claims-blockchain
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Usage

1. Start the blockchain node:

   ```bash
   python insurance1.1.py
   ```

2. The blockchain node will be running on `http://localhost:5000`.

3. Use the provided RESTful API endpoints to interact with the blockchain network:

   - `/mine`: Mine new blocks and receive rewards.
   - `/transactions/new`: Add new insurance claims transactions.
   - `/chain`: View the full blockchain.
   - `/nodes/register`: Register new nodes to the network.
   - `/nodes/resolve`: Resolve conflicts and achieve consensus among nodes.

Refer to the API documentation or the code comments for detailed information on using the endpoints.
